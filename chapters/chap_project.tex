%%%%% CUBESATS

\sec CubeSat concept

Despite growing interest from industry in CubeSats as proper means of technology demonstration, such platforms are still primarily considered as an educational tool. \cite[pap:fromDesignToOperation]

\secc On Board Computer

The three main design parameters of the electronic systems of small satellites are power consumption, physical dimensions and radiation environment behavior. \cite[boo:framInSpace]

%%%%% VST104 MOTIVATION

\sec Project motivation

It is possible to start programming the satellite at the beginning of the project. However, some software developing practices, such as Test-driven Development (TDD), recommend testing the software while it is being developed. Therefore, in practice, software should be directly programmed on the target computer. \cite[pap:fromDesignToOperation]

%%%%% COMPONENTS FOOTPRINTS

\secc Components footprints

\quad Every electronic component needs to be properly attached to the \glref{PCB}'s surface. An arrangement of pads required to solder the component on the \glref{PCB} is called a footprint. Components with different standardized packages require corresponding footprints. These footprints are usually available for download on various websites or are included in the KiCad official libraries. Although it is comfortable to use these premade footprints, this approach brings inconsistency and dependency to the \glref{PCB} design. Therefore we decided to create each of the used footprints by ourselves, following reference designs in components' datasheets and KiCad library conventions \cite[app:kiCadLib].

It is a common feature in modern PCB design software such as KiCad to support a 3D visualization. Besides pads, copper traces or
