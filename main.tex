%%%%% ABSTRACT - skontrolovane

\abstractEN {
    This thesis is focused on the development of PC/104 format electronic boards for CubeSat applications. Particular attention was given to a single on-board computer (OBC) module. This universal ARM-based OBC is driven by an STM32L4 microcontroller supporting a great number of interfaces. Its additional features include robust power management, separate peripheral isolation, triple-redundant FLASH and F-RAM memories, dual CAN bus transceivers, inbuild temperature monitoring, and a significant payload sector. A dedicated radiation testing was conducted under a gamma radiation source. Moreover, three additional boards were developed, including a double redundant version of the OBC, a universal PC/104 module, and a FlatSat test bench. All of these boards were designed with open-source principles in a KiCad environment. This thesis contributes to the VisionSpace Technologies VST104 project by introducing a hardware platform for mission control systems testing and compression algorithms development.
