The VST can be considered a software company since its primary intention is developing and integrating enterprise-level solutions for satellite missions. 

This project's outcome will be a platform for testing mission control systems (MCS), and eventually, new algorithms with a future extension of an onboard field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology. \cite[abs:openSourceWorkshop]
